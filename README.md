## Password Generator

## Description
*This is a 'password generator' used to create a random password to protect personal  information by asking for a specific character sequence when you log onto a website.

* To give peace of mind to the user.

* It was created so anyone can keep their information safe.

* I solved the issue of unsafe document protection.

* I learned building this that I can choose any number of charactors to apply to a password.
